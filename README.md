# FlatSimon
## Just a Flat Design Simon Game
Flat Simon is a simple, in terms of design and working logic, game of colors, sounds and memory.

It is using CoinHive automatically, so, the **app mine monero with your cpu while you are playing**, so much better than some boring ads filling up your screen!
