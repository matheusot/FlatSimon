# FlatSimon
## Just a Flat Design Simon Game
Flat Simon is a simple, in terms of design and working logic, game of colors, sounds and memory.

It is using CoinHive automatically, so, the **app mine monero with your cpu while you are playing**, so much better than some boring ads filling up your screen!

I'm working slowly at this project, so here comes a little big TODO list:

## TODO:
+ Refactor and review code :heavy_check_mark:
+ Remove sound bugs
+ Finish and improve translation (maybe add some translation api)
+ Fix share button on desktop
+ Fix info button
+ Add scoreboard functionality
  + Local Scoreboard with localStorage
  + Global Scoreboard with Firebase
